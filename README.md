# Hangman Game

A classic Hangman game implemented in Java. This project allows users to guess letters of a hidden word with limited attempts, providing an engaging and fun way to test vocabulary and logic skills.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: Words are selected randomly from a predefined list.
- **Guess Tracking**: Keeps track of correct and incorrect guesses.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
- **Dynamic Display**: Displays the progress of the word as it is guessed.
- **Replay Option**: Option to restart the game after it ends.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/333Rayyan/Hangman.git

2. Compile the Java source code:
   ```bash
   javac Hangman.java
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Hangman
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the game by running the `HangmanGame` class.
2. Guess letters to uncover the hidden word:
   - Enter one letter at a time.
   - Incorrect guesses will reduce the number of attempts remaining.
3. Continue guessing until you either:
   - Uncover the entire word, or
   - Run out of attempts.
4. After the game ends, choose to replay or exit.

## Technologies Used
